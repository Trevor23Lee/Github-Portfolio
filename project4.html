        <h1 class="project__title">Keystroke Log Analyzer with Word Extraction and Pattern Detection</h1>
        <p class="project__description">
            In this project, I developed a keylogger, a tool often exploited by malicious actors to gather intelligence from victims. 
            Keyloggers capture and log a victim's keystrokes, enabling the collection of sensitive information.

            To enhance the functionality, I created an additional script to analyze the logged data and identify patterns. 
            Since the raw log file records one keystroke per line, the script first reconstructs this data into readable text. 
            Once reconstructed, the script detects patterns that could be of interest to an attacker, such as the most common words, URLs, email addresses, and potential passwords.
            
            This analysis allows an attacker to identify websites, along with associated emails and passwords, facilitating unauthorized access. 
            The processed output clearly displays these findings, making it easier to interpret the extracted data.

        <h2 class="project__subheading">What I Learned</h2>
        <ul class="project__learnings">
          <p>
            Through this project, I gained several key insights that will benefit my future career as a cybersecurity analyst. One critical takeaway was understanding the security
             implications of how straightforward it is to create and implement a keylogger. Keyloggers are relatively easy to develop or acquire, and a threat actor merely needs to
              deploy a payload for the victim to execute the script, which can often evade detection.

            Additionally, this project deepened my proficiency in Python, particularly through the use of libraries like pynput for capturing keystrokes and re for regex-based pattern matching. 
            As I progressed, I found myself continuously expanding the functionality of the script. Initially focused on detecting common words and URLs, I later incorporated features to recognize emails and potential passwords.

            Looking ahead, there are several enhancements I'm considering, such as encrypting output files, conducting more detailed analysis of typing patterns, and expanding pattern recognition capabilities. 
            These additions could further improve the project's scope and relevance to real-world cybersecurity challenges.
