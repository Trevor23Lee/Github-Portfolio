          Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark to identify potential
           security issues such as unencrypted traffic, packet sniffing, or suspicious protocols.

            Throughout this project, I have learned a few useful skills that I can integrate into any SOC analyst role. 
            While working on getting Wireshark setup, I watched some videos on how to traverse Wireshark as well as how to 
            set up the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the way I prefer. Which included a few things like color management, 
            tabs for specific filters, console layout, etc. After the intial setup I learned how capture and filter network traffic.
            Learning how to identifypotential security risks, such as cleartext passwords, insecure protocols(FTP, HTTP) or 
            potential intrusions. As well as an understanding on how attacks like Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or ARP poisoning works.
